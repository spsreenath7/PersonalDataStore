 + Create custom items
 + Control the data sharing with privacy dashboard  
 

## Installation requirements.

Note: All the required node modules are saved in package.json, so no seperate installation of modules required. To run the app first start the local JSON server and then start the npm.

+ All user and app data is stored and retrived using mock rest API, offered by JSON sever utility.
+ Used componentDidMount which is invoked to load the user profile and activity data  immediately after their respective component is mounted.
+ To enhance user experience, used third party components like antd and reactstrap. Also utilised the proptypes supported by those components to achieve the required fearture.
